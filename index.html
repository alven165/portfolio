                <p><h1>Having a system that can automatically capture student attendance by flashing their student card at an RFID reader will help alleviate all of the above issues. 
                    This is the primary goal of our system, and having an online system that can be accessed from anywhere and at any time will considerably aid lecturers in keeping track of their students' 
                    attendance. Looking at the big picture, using the system across the academic faculty will assist academic administration because student attendance is a significant 
                    role in improving teaching quality and monitoring their students' success. Students must hand sign the attendance sheet every time they attend a class under the current traditional 
                    attendance system. As typical as it may appear, such a system lacks automation, which can lead to a variety of issues. This includes the time students waste looking for and signing their papers.Â 
                    Some kids may inadvertently or intentionally sign another student's name on the attendance sheet. Additionally, the attendance sheet could be misplaced.

            <H1>Each user, student, will have an RFID card in this system. A RFID reader will be installed on the company's entrance or entry gate, as well as the door to the classroom or school. 
                    Employees must show their RFID card to the reader whenever they wish to enter the office. He or she must bring the RFID card quite close to the RFID reader. The RFID reader will then record the 
                    RFID card number as well as the time the employee or student logged in. Similarly, when departing, the employee/student must display the card. As a result, the exit time will be recorded.</li>
